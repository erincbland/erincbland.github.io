            <p>I'm going to type out the story of this project. I was working on it last night, 
                but for some reason it kept saying can't connect to local host. I couldn't figure it out,
            so I sent you an email. But this morning, I woke up and realized that I had it all in the wrong folder!
        There was also something weird that I deleted... hopefully I won't need it later.</p>
